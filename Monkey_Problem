/*************************************************************************
x = amount of peaches the monkey collects
(x/2)-1 = how many peaches the monkey ate per day

the 1 represents the addition peach eaten and the 2 represents the total divided in half 

day 10 = 1 peach left

So,......... the amount of peaches at the beginning of these days are: 
(x+1)*2 = equation

day 9 = (1 + 1) * 2 = 4 peaches
day 8 = (4 + 1) * 2 = 10 peaches
day 7 = (10 + 1) * 2 = 22 peaches
day 6 = (22 + 1) * 2 = 46 peaches
day 5 = (46 + 1) * 2 = 94 peaches
day 4 = (94 + 1) * 2 = 190 peaches
day 3 = (190 + 1) * 2 = 382 peaches
day 2 = (382 + 1) * 2 = 766 peaches
day 1 = (766 + 1) * 2 = 1534 peaches

or 

1 = (x/2)-1

then, 2 = x/2

then, 4 = x

so the day before there were 4 peaches.
